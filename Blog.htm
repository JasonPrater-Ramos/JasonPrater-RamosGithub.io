I would say what makes video games so enticing and entertaining is that they allow you to be someone else. They allow the player to do something they wouldnt be able to normally do in real life. Also they amount of things that go on in a game allow the player to stay engaged and keep them entertained.

The article is about the reasons why people choose to play video games. For some its a way to destress and for others its a way to compete with others. It talks about how they are a way for people to talk to others or fail at something without the consequences they would have in the real world ( debatable honestly, if you have ever played any competitive video game). The article talks about how video games give players a sense of freedom and allows them to explore a vast area, such as Ark or No Man’s Sky.

Review by Tank Holmes

I hate how I fire first but nothing happens but the enemy fires it's a instant mill
A recent battle I was a kv1 facing a tiger e
We were barrel length I fired first smoke and everything but the tiger fires second I get killed. Instead of fixing bugs and prevent spawn camps, they created king of the hill mode. This game might give me a heart attack or something you can get for rage. The most recent game i played they spawn camped in bf109s. At this point I want to delete it and never want to play again
Edit: The update with the helicopters are disappointing. The only way to take out choppers is by using long range TOW missiles or AAM at spawn to the middle of the map. It does not give anyone with a lower tier heli a chance to do anything. Everytime I spawn in I get hit with a missile from at least 10km away. They should have never put them in the game. The only reason I’m still playing is for some friends or else I would have kept the game deleted.
I wish they could fix the BR and spawn because I was a IS, a 5.7, but there was a Ho Ri prototype a 7.0, at our spawn killing us. It deteriorates my motivation to continue playing the game.
I’m at a complete loss of words. These battles for spawn camping is outrageous. I swear if i could turn back time I would never spend my time with this game. I keep asking myself, should I keep going even though they never fix it or I should delete 4-5 years worth of playing time forever. Games I delete save data are games I never play again. I don’t think this is good for my mental health to continue.
 At this point i only play because it’s the only game where I can play without my friends. The amount of spawn camping, bugs that were never fixed, and sniping helicopters. After all of this, I don’t know anymore.I love how long the game have been out, yet there is still a bug that Hasn’t even been fixed. Every time I aim at a target, the game always makes my tank aim the complete opposite direction of that target. I wish they could use the money to fix the one of the main problems that everyone faces. Why do I try? They’re not going to even fix the helicopters. I played in 2 matches, where I see nothing but 3-4 ka-50s spawn camping. I got nothing to say, but they are stubborn to realize the mistake that they made, and incompetent to do anything to deal with it.Three games in and spawn camping here and there. This game has been out for years now and theres no landscape cover. most maps that does only have 1. Even those spawns get overrun real quick. I can’t even write this comment without having a headache. Makes me not want to even do any events for it. The event just started too, I swear I feel that they are incompetent to fixed the camps. Can anyone of the company make a map where it is impossible to spawn camp. During the ash river battle there were multiple tank by the crash plane instantly taking out my team. As soon as I spawned in my so-ki spaa, a tiger 2(10.5 cm) took out my crew members. How can anyone enjoy a game if they can’t do anything

Can anyone please fix these freaking bugs or are you incompetent of making a game in the first place. I been experiencing an invisible wall bug that got me killed multiple times. The recent one is where I have artillery called on me and an invisible wall prevented me to move. Use the money you have accumulated (if you ever gain any) to fix bugs to improve the game. That is a simple objective to try to achieve


So I agree with the spawn camping stuff, but complaining about a kv-1 losing to a tiger e doesnt make sense. Kv has no way of penetrating the tiger except for the side while the tiger can pen everywhere on the kv assuming the kv is not angled. Even if it was a kv-1e or kv-1s, they stand no chance against a tiger e. As for spawn camping and BR I agree as both are big problems in the game. With how BR currently is you can be playing a ww2 era tank and get uptiered and play against cold war era tanks. The only preventive measure against spawn camping the game has is a short grace period of immortality. I also agree with the gripes he has with map design. Maps look cool and all, but they make it way too easy to make shots across the map, The maps also cater to tanks that are meant for close quarters combat such as american and russian tanks. German and swedish tanks suffer on such maps because they rely on gun depression(sweden) and large open fields(germany) which many of the maps do no have.

I want this one as it will be able to run the games that I play at high frames and at good graphics settings. It will also allow me to make much better 3d renders and hopefully stream my games. The pc I currently have is an all in one pc and while it works, it doesnt provide a satisfactory gaming experience.

What makes a good fighting game is balanced characters that are capable of countering eachother. Along with that is making everything feel alive, so good animation, map, and sound design. It also needs moves that are able to combo with each other. One of the worst games in this genre is Hulk Hogan’s Main event due to its bad graphics and generic gameplay. One of the best ones is Mortal Kombat, a name many people are familiar with. Great graphics, characters, movesets, It’s no wonder why it has been around for so long.

I think our information on the presentation was accurate and was well put together. If we had more time we could have made the presentation better looking and possibly added more information. I didn’t really have a favorite or least favorite part, it was just another assignment to do so I got it done.

Toxicity in gaming is a rampant problem. A majority of gamers say they experience racist, sexist, homophobic, and a ton of other questionable commets. Many people interviewed said that toxic comments made them contemplate suicide while others said that it caused them to quit the game. I think the best way to combat toxicity in gaming is to ignore it or if you feel the need to respond, respond with positivity.

A pro team that I like is Moist Esports. They have multiple teams in Smash, Apex, LOL, and more. I think what makes them a good team is that they have good chemistry and that they don’t take themselves too seriously. They do well on apex and LOL. I dont really know what they need to work on.

The articles is discussing whether or not chatbots are having a large impact on the on people postdoc. Many say it hasn't really changed anything besides making things faster. Others say it makes a large difference on their lives. According to the aritcle 31% of the responders use chatbots and 41% of them use it weekly. This concerns some people as it shows that many postdocs are not up to standard when it comes to scientific writing.
<hr>
My opinion of this technology is that its not harmful, for now. I think it can harm certain people such as artists and writers and possibly other professions that require writing. I personaly use AI for fun or to give me ideas when I'm stuck while writing something. Just to give me an idea of how the thing should look. Now if AI starts getting to advanced then it could be a problem since we would have a much harder time trying to figure out what is man-made or what is AI.

<p8> So may favorite PC game would be world of tanks, my favorite console game would be Dark Souls 2, and my favorite moblie game would be Fate Grand Order.
My favorite game of all time would be Battlefield Bad company 2. I havent played the game in a good while, but it had fun gameplay and an interesting story.The reviews are all pretty positive with most people people saying the same thing as me so I would have to agree with them.

<p9>OBS is easy in you just click a couple buttons and you can start recording. The hard part is saving it to the right place. I did not use Overlay since it seems complicated. Speaking while recording is simpiler in terms of editing, but you might get in the zone and just not talk. It takes a bit of work to get the hang of if you do commentary. You can just read the script instead of having to make things up as you go.
